# Ayu Owl

There are lots of great Theme for Visual Studio Code in the marketplace. I used to use [Night Owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl) and [Ayu Mirage](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=teabyii.ayu), but I couldn't decide between them, so I decided to create a theme based on these two great themes. 😝

## Installation

1.  Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2.  Launch Visual Studio Code
3.  Choose **Extensions** from menu
4.  Search for `ayu-owl`
5.  Click **Install** to install it
6.  Click **Reload** to reload the Code
7.  From the menu bar click: Code > Preferences > Color Theme > **Ayu Owl**
